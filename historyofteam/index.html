	<h1>Playoffs</h1>
	<p>Post season has always been something that has been a struggle for the Blue Jays, mostly due to the fact that there always seem's to be a month or two in the season that they just blow it.</p>
	<p>Take the 2013 season for example, they had a very good start to the season, and at the All-Star break, they were almost .500. The rest of the season though, they were off and on. Unfortunetly they were more off than they were on and ended the season 4 games back from the wild card match, making it 21 years since their last playoff appearence.</p>
